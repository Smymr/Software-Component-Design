 # ARDI: Augmented Reality Museum Guide Application

## Introduction

The **ARDI (Augmented Reality Museum Guide Application)** is a cutting-edge initiative designed to transform the way visitors interact with museum exhibits. By leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology, the application delivers immersive, interactive experiences that provide detailed information, historical context, and enhanced engagement with museum displays.

This project follows the **Rapid Application Development (RAD) model** and incorporates **Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE)** principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and efficient development.

## Project Objectives
- Deliver immersive, interactive guides for museum exhibits using AR technology.
- Create a modular, reusable design aligned with CBSE principles.
- Demonstrate iterative prototyping and stakeholder feedback integration as per the RAD model.

## Components Overview
1. **Action Bar**: Quick access to essential actions like navigation, refreshing content, and scanning.
2. **Menu**: Structured navigation to app sections such as Home, About Us, and Exit.
3. **Search Bar**: Intuitive search functionality for exhibits or topics.
4. **Profile Details**: User account management and activity overview.

## Development Process: RAD Model Application
1. **Requirements Planning**: Gathered from stakeholders and team discussions.
2. **User Design**:
   - Low-fidelity sketches outlining structure and functionality.
   - Medium-fidelity prototyping in Figma with reusable components.
   - Regular stakeholder feedback for iterative improvements.
3. **Construction**: Interactive simulations built in Figma to mimic app functionality.
4. **Cutover**: Final Figma prototype delivered to showcase all app features and interactions.

## Component-Based Software Engineering Principles
- **Modular Design**: Independent modules for each feature (e.g., action bar, menu, search bar).
- **Reusability**: Consistent reuse of components across screens.
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Iterative refinements for incremental and modular improvements.

## Figma Prototype
The Figma prototype for the ARDI project can be accessed here: [(https://www.figma.com/design/xBi7Hsy2SlNpddxGpHbgnz/Figma-museum-guide-app?node-id=1669-162202&t=4qhumbenqMMiTxTF-1)].

## Conclusion
The ARDI project exemplifies the integration of RAD principles and CBSE concepts to design an innovative, user-centric museum guide application. The Figma prototype showcases a comprehensive, modular, and interactive solution for museum visitors.
